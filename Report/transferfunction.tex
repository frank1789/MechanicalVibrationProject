\chapter{Transfer Function}\label{chap:tf}
The transfer function was calculated from the system equation
\eqref{eq:equationmotion} analysed in the section
\ref{subsec:equationofomotion}, where the input is \(g_{\text{v}}\).
To calculate the transfer function between the force and the positions, the 
voltage-to-foce coefficient gain has to be removed.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gs}
	G(s) = \big([M]s^2+[C]s+[K]\big)^{-1}
\end{equation}
Given \(F(s)\) we obtain the Laplace transform of the force signal.
The transfer function is a column vector with three entries, one for each output,
they share the denominator as in eq.\eqref{eq:gs}.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tf}
	\frac{X(s)}{F(s)} = \frac{1}{g_{\text{v}}}\,\frac{X(s)}{V(s)}
\end{equation}
